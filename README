This is a script that will extract, modify, and create the files needed in order to replace the sysresccd rescue64 kernel with your own custom kernel 
and include the spl/zfs modules and refresh the dependency list (depmod).

How to use this script?

1. Compile your rescue64 kernel, and compile the spl and zfs modules (On Gentoo/Funtoo: emerge -1 spl zfs-kmod)
2. Run the 'create.sh' script and pass the name of the kernel directory and the iso. (Example: ./create.sh 3.4.52-std371-amd64 /root/sysresccd.iso)
3. Take the files in the 'out' directory and replace the files in their respective locations with an iso editor. I use 'ISO Master'.

You will also need to have bliss-initramfs installed since it uses the initramfs that the application creates as a base for the files needed to be merged into
the system rescue cd's root filesystem (sysrcd.dat).
