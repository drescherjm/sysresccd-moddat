This is a script that will extract, modify, and create the files needed 
in order to replace the sysresccd 64 bit kernels with your own custom kernels,
include the spl/zfs modules, and refresh the dependency list (depmod).

How to use this script?

1. Compile your substitute rescue/altker64 bit kernels, 
and compile the spl and zfs modules (On Gentoo: emerge -1 spl zfs-kmod)

2. Run the 'create.sh' script and pass the name of the kernel directory and the iso. (Example: ./create.sh 3.10.32-std410-amd64 3.13.5-alt410-amd64 /root/sysresccd.iso)

3. Take the files in the 'out' directory and replace the files in their respective locations with an iso editor. I use 'ISO Master'.

You will also need to have bliss-initramfs installed since it uses the initramfs that the application creates as a base for the files needed to be merged into the system rescue cd's root filesystem (sysrcd.dat).
